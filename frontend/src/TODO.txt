1. wrong login credentials error message not showing
2. logging out from the profile page, leaves you in a blank profile page.
3. undefined product/id get request firing off when i go into the cartscreen.
4. after user info update, dispatch login, to update everything.  this way is cleaner.
5. check if passwords don't match.
